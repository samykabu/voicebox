# Changelog

## 1.4.0 (unreleased)

- Move canonical source from Bunyan; add managed effort policy, automatic clarification reread and configurable board/artifact mappings.
- Revalidate open progressed features under matching workflow claims without resetting
  their board status; retain current approval and unresolved-question guards.

## 1.3.0

- Automatically invoke Plan from either Clarify or Brainstorm after a fully resolved
  review has published successfully and the live issue is Ready.
- Carry the exact source issue and specification through the shared handoff and
  preserve Plan's mandatory guards and Project hooks.
- Do not trigger Plan for previews, pending questions, exhausted rounds, failed
  publication, or closure that waives unresolved decisions.

## 1.2.1

- Present lettered, initially unchecked choices with a bold Recommended suffix.
- Read a single checked option as answer evidence; support normal comments with
  question IDs and optional feedback, including several answers in one comment.
- Collapse supporting context and diagrams while keeping the recommendation visible.
- Detect changed selections during publication and reject ambiguous checkbox evidence.

## 1.2.0

- Present complexity findings and let the user choose the total number of new issues.
- Require explicit approval of the exact proposal before any publication writes.
- Bind local approval receipts to the proposal, source, prerequisites and selected count.

- Share unattended GitHub question rounds, creator mentions, answer evidence and spec integration.

## 1.0.0
