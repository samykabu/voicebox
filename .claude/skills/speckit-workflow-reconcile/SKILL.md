# Sanduq Workflow: reconcile

Input: $ARGUMENTS

Read `.specify/extensions/workflow/skills/workflow/SKILL.md` and follow the `reconcile` entry point.
Use the current explicit feature or issue. Do not infer issue identity from an unrelated editor tab.
The shared skill owns orchestration; do not run a second pipeline after it returns.
